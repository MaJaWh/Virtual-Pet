## INTRODUCTION

A totaly virtual pet! Our first virtual pet made using Java Script for week 5 of the Manchester Codes Software Engineering Track. This project was our introduction to the world of Object Oriented Programming.

We were also introduced to the NODE CLI and how to run the project inside this virtual sandbox for testing the functionality of our code.

The virtual pet has 4 features.
• Name
• Age
• Hunger
• Fitness

## FUTURE UPDATES

I aim to increase the functionality of the pet in the puture and create a GUI for a better user experience
